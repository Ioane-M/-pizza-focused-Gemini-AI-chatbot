Some onions and mushrooms go really well with bacon, or maybe some spinach for a pop of color and added nutrients?\n",

            "Just let me know what you're thinking, and we'll get that pizza started for you! We even have a *light* bacon option if you want to save some calories. Let's make this diet-friendly pizza absolutely amazing!\n",
